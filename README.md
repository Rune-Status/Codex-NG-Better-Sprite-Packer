# Better Sprite Packer
## What is better sprite packer?
**Better sprite packer (BSP)** is a program that effeciently compresses images into a single file by quantizing the image colors down to a palette of 256 colors and by packing the pixels
in binary form instead of the entire image data.

### Features
* BSP has very high compression with no quality loss.
* Images are first quantized down to 256 colors.
* Pixels are packed in binary form.
* Supports only png, and jpg. jpeg results in too much distortion due to many colors.
* Can arrange sprites into binary folders called image archives.
* Can add/remove/delete spries using your native operating system.
* Supports transparency, currently the color magenta is marked transparent by default.

### Version 2.0 coming soon
